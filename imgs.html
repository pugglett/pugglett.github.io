<p>Thank you for writing me! First of all, I want to clarify my emotions regarding the conversation last night.</p>

<p>I was not bothered/upset by you at all! I was a little frustrated that I'd put my foot in it (intentionally or not) but that's a common occurrence for me so I often brush off those feelings and work towards fixing my mistakes. But, honestly, I was just happy you told me how you felt! </p>

<p>That totally makes sense regarding why you felt that way. Thank you for explaining it to me! I also just really love complaining so a lot of my complaints are very mild in reality. </p>

<p>I also compare myself to others//had a lot of academic potential and dropped the ball//have felt my brain atrophy over the years. I can definitely relate to that!
</p>
<p>I think it's possible for me to find the friends I need in a city on my own. When I'm not depressed, I am pretty good at socializing and making friends. My happiness and needs (all of them) are not your responsibility and I do not expect them to be.
</p>
<p>My ex's playlist, as she told me last night, was actually a fandom playlist so was not about me and her at all. That's not really relevant but it's pretty funny.
</p>
<p>I would not move to Chicago for you. That sounds harsh but I just could not do that. I would move somewhere for me. I just need to do some research and decide where is best! 
</p>
<p>And when I move it will inevitably be bad. That's just how I am. I WILL have a breakdown. I will have downswing upon downswing. But that's not your fault and it would not be your responsibility to relieve that. 
</p>
<p>As for me judging you intellectually.... That's not the case. Easier to hear than to accept, I know but I thought I should put it out there. I do think you are very intelligent but I also understand that academia etc can make you uncomfortable. Basically.... I don't know how to put this in a manageable way. Try not to worry about it!
</p>
<p>I love you, Lee. I'm sorry I haven't been better about communicating lately! I had a mild downswing that I'm working my way out of (almost entirely out of the pit today!). I know that it can be hard for me not to reach out to you//respond to you. I'm really sorry about that. I wish I could say I will change but I do not think I can. When I am depressed, my phone//talking to people is the last thing I am thinking about. But please try not to take this personally. Thankfully I cycle pretty quickly so you probably won't hear from me//I'll be very terse for a week and a half or so at most.
</p>
<p>As for the state of our relationship//what you've got with David, etc etc.... Don't worry about it. It's all totally secondary to our friendship and I'm not worried about it at all. What happens will happen or not! No big deal!!!
</p>
<p>I love you, Lee! I get off work at 5 tonight... Can I call you?
